  *What is it and why was it made?*

  The project was made using node.js in an effort to simplify README creation for GitHUb projects going forward. The generator provides a foundation for README creation that is flexible enough to fit differing project goals. The generator creates a firm foundation from which to build a variety of project README files with a dynamic table of contents depending on developer's focus.
